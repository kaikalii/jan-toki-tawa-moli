# Details

This is a Toki Pona translation of Orson Scott Card's excellent sci-fi novel, *Speaker for the Dead*. Rather, it is an attempt at a translation. *Speaker for the Dead* is not a simply-written book, and translating it requires pushing Toki Pona to the furthest limits of its semantic capabilities. While, having written it, I can understand what it happening fairly well, the true test will be when a person who is fluent in Toki Pona but has never read the book attempts to read it. Will it even be possible for them to understand what is happening? Some parts, like dialogue, are simple enough. However, explanations of politics or science can be difficult to decode.
