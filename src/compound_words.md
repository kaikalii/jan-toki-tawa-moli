# Common Toki Pona Compound Words

*Speaker for the Dead* is not a simple book. It has a lot of complex ideas that a Toki Pona translator has to break down into its component parts. However, the meaning of these complex compound words is not always immediately apparent. For this reason, I have included this section listing the most common compound words used in this translation.

## Things to Remember

This translation pushes the capabilities of Toki Pona to its absolute limits, but remembering some of the less-commonly-taught alternate meanings of words can help with understanding:

* toki usually has to do with talking, speech, and language, but it also can mean *think*, and by extension, *idea*

* as a preposition, tawa means to, from, toward, from the perspective of, but as an adjective, it means *moving*. By extension, it means *to move* as a verb:
    * tawa sewi - move upward - climb
    * tawa noka - move downward - fall
    * tawa wawa - move energetically - run
